# Architecture

Reddit Researcher is a small pipeline. It does five things in order and writes everything to disk.

```text
+----------------+     +------------------+     +----------------+     +-------------+     +-----------+
| 1. Load        | --> | 2. Reddit JSON   | --> | 3. Normalize   | --> | 4. Relevance| --> | 5. Ollama |
|    project.toml|     |    fetch         |     |    + persist   |     |    review   |     |   extract |
+----------------+     +------------------+     +----------------+     +-------------+     +-----------+
                              |                          |                    |                  |
                              v                          v                    v                  v
                          raw/*.json              normalized/*.jsonl     review/*.jsonl     analysis/*.md
```

## Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `cli.py`           | Argparse front door. Translates flags into config dataclasses and dispatches to the pipeline. |
| `config.py`        | Loads and validates `project.toml`. Resolves relative paths against the project folder. |
| `reddit_client.py` | JSON-endpoint backend (no auth) plus the `make_reddit_client(scrape)` factory. |
| `praw_client.py`   | Optional [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/) backend. Selected by `[scrape].backend = "praw"`; needs the `praw` extra. |
| `ollama_client.py` | Thin wrapper over Ollama's HTTP API. Surfaces missing models with the available list. |
| `pipeline.py`      | Orchestrates scrape → normalize → relevance → extract. Handles checkpointing. |
| `prompting.py`     | Loads prompt files, builds corpora, chunks long text, and assembles model prompts. |
| `relevance.py`     | Deterministic, configurable pre-LLM filter. Decides `include`, `review`, or `exclude`. |
| `storage.py`       | JSON, JSONL, and run-folder helpers. The output contract lives here. |
| `progress.py`      | Per-run logger that writes to `logs/scrape.log` and `logs/extract.log`. |
| `models.py`        | `PostRecord` and `CommentRecord` dataclasses. |

## Data contract

Every run writes the same shape:

```text
runs/<scope>/<timestamp>/
  manifest.json              run metadata
  raw/                       unmodified Reddit responses
  normalized/                clean rows for analysis
  review/                    relevance decisions
  analysis/                  LLM output
  logs/                      per-stage logs
```

This layout is intentionally flat and human-greppable. Forks should treat it as the public
interface — adding files is fine, renaming or restructuring is a breaking change.

## Invariants worth knowing

- **Scrapes are append-only.** A failed scrape does not delete prior progress; resuming into the
  same `--run-dir` re-uses everything in `normalized/`. As of 0.1.0 this applies to both subreddit
  and search modes.
- **Extractions reuse chunks.** `analysis/chunks/chunk-NNN.md` is reused if non-empty unless
  `--force-reextract` is passed.
- **Relevance is cheap and deterministic.** It runs in-process with no network calls. The LLM only
  ever sees posts whose decision is `include` or `review`.
- **Search-mode corpora are grouped by `search_term`.** This lets a per-term prompt produce a
  per-term section in the synthesis.
- **Manifests are versioned.** Every `manifest.json` written by 0.1.0+ carries a `schema_version`
  field. See "Manifest schema" below.

## Manifest schema

The current schema version is **1**, defined in `reddit_researcher/manifest.py`. Manifests
written before 0.1.0 do not have this field and are treated as v0; this matters only for
forward-compat code, since v0 → v1 was a strict superset (the field was added; nothing was
removed). The version bumps when a *required* field is added, removed, or changes meaning;
optional additions don't bump it. Each bump gets a CHANGELOG entry with migration guidance.

## Environment variables

Three variables reach into the defaults pipeline:

- `OLLAMA_URL` — replaces the built-in `http://127.0.0.1:11434` endpoint.
- `OLLAMA_MODEL` — replaces the built-in `qwen3:8b` default model.
- `REDDIT_RESEARCHER_USER_AGENT` — replaces the polite-default User-Agent header.

Loading order is repo-root `.env` → project `.env` → shell environment → `project.toml` →
CLI flags, with the higher item always winning. The dotenv parser is in
`reddit_researcher/env.py` and is intentionally tiny (no expansion, no multi-line values).

## Why TOML for projects

- Built into the standard library on Python 3.11+ (`tomllib`). No new dependency.
- Easy to read, easy to diff. Comments are first-class.
- Strict typing avoids the YAML "Norway problem" and ambiguous numbers.

## JSON vs PRAW backends

The default `"json"` backend reads Reddit's public JSON endpoints. Zero-config: no
`client_id`, `client_secret`, refresh tokens, or registered apps. Sufficient for low-volume
research and the path most forks will take.

The optional `"praw"` backend ships in 0.1.1 for users who need authenticated access:

- Higher rate-limit ceiling than the unauth endpoint.
- Listings can return more than 1000 posts.
- Comment trees automatically expand `MoreComments` placeholders.

Trade-offs:

- Adds the `praw` Python dependency (install via `pip install reddit-researcher[praw]`).
- Requires registering a "script" app on Reddit and stashing the resulting
  `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` / `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` in your shell or a `.env` file.
- `pause_seconds` and `max_retries` are ignored; PRAW manages its own backoff.

Both backends emit identical `PostRecord` / `CommentRecord` shapes and produce the same
run-folder layout, so a project can be flipped from JSON to PRAW (or back) by changing one
line in `project.toml`.

## Why Ollama, not a hosted LLM

- Local-first: data never leaves the machine, no API key handling, no per-token spend during
  iteration.
- Practical for prompt tuning: rerunning extraction over the same scrape is free.
- The `OllamaClient` API is intentionally narrow (`generate`, `list_models`). Swapping it for a
  different local backend is a one-file change.

## Caveats and known limitations

These are real friction points that have shown up in practice. They aren't bugs — most are
properties of Reddit's public surface — but they shape how you design a project.

- **Reddit's anonymous in-subreddit search returns empty for many small subs.** The
  `/r/<sub>/search.json?restrict_sr=1` endpoint is heavily restricted without OAuth. A search
  that obviously *should* match (e.g. `dispensary` in a sub that constantly discusses dispensaries)
  often returns zero results. The `top.json` and `hot.json` listing endpoints work fine. Workarounds:
  use subreddit mode against each sub directly, or switch to the PRAW backend.
- **A single project targets one subreddit (subreddit mode) or one search across an allowlist
  (search mode).** There is currently no "scrape these N subreddits' top listings into one
  combined run" mode. Workaround: use `pipeline.scrape_subreddit()` from a small Python harness
  with the same `run_dir` for each call. Multi-subreddit subreddit mode is on the
  [0.2.0 roadmap](roadmap.md).
- **The default JSON backend caps at ~1000 posts per listing.** Reddit's pagination soft-limits
  there. For deeper pulls, switch to PRAW.
- **Comment trees are top-N, not exhaustive.** `fetch_comments` pulls the top `comment_limit`
  comments in one request; very large threads' deep replies are clipped. PRAW expands this fully
  via `MoreComments` resolution.
- **The relevance filter is intentionally simple** (substring + keyword). It runs *before* the
  LLM as a cost-control pass, not as a final classifier. The LLM is allowed to disagree, and the
  relevance rules are easy to misconfigure (too narrow → empty `relevant_posts.jsonl`; too
  broad → no signal).
